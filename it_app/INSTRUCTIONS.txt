Inital Setup:

	1. ./setup.sh

		   To setup the databse please run the following commands in the mysql repl:

		   use team3;
                   source DeviceTracker.sql;
	
		b. Once this is done. Please edit the config.ini file as follows:
			I. For the host, please enter your caseid and/or the username of
			   of the MYSQL user you'll be acessing the database with.
	3. Exit the MYSQL repl and run source venv/bin/activate
